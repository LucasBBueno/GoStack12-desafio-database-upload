# gostack12-desafio-database-upload
Repository for 6th challenge of Rocketseat's bootcamp


## :memo: About
In this application, we used the same 'Transaction' system idea of the previous challenge and was introduced the database connection using TypeORM and Postgre. Was created migrations files to determine the database structure. Also, we used Multer and csv-parse to deal with csv upload file to realize the import of transactions.

- TypeScript in node.js;
